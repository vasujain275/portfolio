About Me (LLM Website Context)

I'm Vasu Jain, a highly motivated and self-driven CSE undergrad from India, currently entering my third year. I'm passionate about backend development, DevOps, and practical GenAI applications. I am a backend and ai enginer working on robust backend microservices and agentic ai workflows, and I’m actively working toward that with a rigorous self-study and project schedule: 2 hours of DSA daily and 3 hours dedicated to backend systems, cloud, and GenAI development.

I'm proficient in Java, Go, TypeScript, Python, SQL, Shell, and Nix. My backend expertise spans Spring Boot (REST APIs, JWT auth, RBAC, JPA, validations, microservices via Spring Cloud), Node.js (Express/Fastify + Prisma), Go (Gin, GORM/sqlc), and FastAPI. I’ve built and deployed fullstack projects such as a Student Management System, a Bookstore API, and a blazing-fast IPL RAG Chatbot (FastAPI + LangChain + Qdrant + React) hosted on my own domain. I’m comfortable building secure, scalable REST APIs, integrating Swagger/OpenAPI, and implementing custom validation and exception handling.

On the DevOps side, I have real-world experience with Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, reverse proxies like Caddy and NGINX, and infrastructure basics on AWS (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, IAM). I’ve automated deployment workflows and collaborated on open-source projects like the Palisadoes Foundation’s talawa-api and talawa-admin, where I contributed Dockerization, CI/CD, and deployment best practices.

In the GenAI space, I’m hands-on with LangChain, LangGraph, vector databases (Qdrant), embedding pipelines, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). I’ve built personal RAG systems using my own datasets and I'm exploring advanced orchestration, multi-agent patterns, and human-in-the-loop pipelines. I prioritize privacy, context-awareness, and humor retention—especially in Hinglish chats—making my GenAI experiments deeply personal and innovative.

I also have frontend experience using React, Vite, TypeScript, Zustand, shadcn/ui, and React Router. While I don’t aim to be a frontend specialist, I’m capable of building clean, responsive, and fullstack-ready UIs. I’ve worked with Astro and am open to using frameworks like Next.js or Expo when needed.

My projects are hosted on my GitHub (vasujain275) and deployed on my custom domain (e.g., ipl-chatbot.vasujain.me, bookstore-api.vasujain.me). I’m currently working on a secure, offline-first Library Management System for a DRDO DIPR project using Spring Boot, MySQL, and React.

I’m actively preparing for certifications like AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Developer Associate, and exploring programs like MLH Fellowship, LFX Mentorship, and Google Summer of Code to expand my experience. I’ve contributed to open source, built strong project pipelines, and continue to refine both my CS fundamentals (OS, protocols, async I/O) and real-world engineering ability.

If you’re looking for someone who combines backend mastery, DevOps reliability, and GenAI creativity—with an obsession for clean architecture and shipping meaningful products—I’m your person.
